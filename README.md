# Model-Independent Fit
A model-independent fit based on Yet Another PWA Toolkit ([YAP](https://github.com/yap/YAP)), Bayesian Analysis Toolkit ([BAT](https://github.com/bat/bat)), and [ROOT](https://root.cern.ch/).

__NOTE:__ This code is not meant to be compiled straight-away. I embedded this model-independent fit in a YAP source tree with _CMakeFiles.txt_ properly edited in order to integrate it.
